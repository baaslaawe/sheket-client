# Sheket Android Client

Sheket is an Android based inventory tracking system designed
for small businesses in areas with limited internet.
It supports multi-user tracking across multiple branches.

Sheket supports manager or employee access across multiple
users. Users can also "subscribe" to multiple companies in 
different roles. 

Sheket allows manipulating inventory levels when there is 
no internet connection. To do this, it locally caches
changes until sync. When syncing, the backend applies
the user's changes and finally returns the latest
inventory levels.
